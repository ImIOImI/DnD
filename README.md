##DnD Roller Chrome Extension

This extension runs on DnD Beyond and puts a listener on the spell casting buttons. When you
 cast a spell, it pops a modal that calculates the hit to attack/save (it rolls attack rolls 
 twice just in case you need to attack with advantage or disadvantage) and the damage of the
 attack. It's compatible with multiattack spells like scourching ray, and displays the attack 
 rolls and the damage for each ray. 
 
###Install

Because this package isn't available in chrome's extension market place, yet, you will need 
to follow the following steps to install it:
1) Download the package
2) Navigate to chrome:extensions in the omnibar.
3) Make sure the Developer Mode box is checked
4) Click on "Load unpacked extension"
5) In the file browser, navigate to your directory and click Open

###Further Dev

I'm looking to:
* Create buttons on attack actions that calculate attacks the same way spells are calculated
* Style the modal to display advantage and disadvantage rolls optionally
* Make the modal respond to your character class and present options for quickening/twining/overcharging, etc.
* Add compatibility with slack so roll data can appear in a chat
